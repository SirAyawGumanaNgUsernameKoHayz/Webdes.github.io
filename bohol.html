                There’s nothing else better to see in Bohol than Chocolate Hills. 
                All other Bohol tourist spots pale in comparison to this UNESCO World Heritage site. 
                There are over 1,300 to 1,700 hills that paint the view scape of the province

                Bohol is also known for the tiny, monkey-looking, wide-eyed creatures it has in its forests. Tarsiers are aplenty in this Visayan province. 
                You can view and play with them at the Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary. For a minimal fee, 
                you can see observe these comic-looking animals in their natural habitat.

            <div class="caption"> 3.) Hanging Bridge <br>
                Dubbed by CNN as one of the Most Spectacular Foot Bridges in the World, the Bohol Hanging Bridge is a must-visit. 
                The 131-foot long bridge is made of bamboo and steel and hovers 25-meters atop the Loboc River.
                 It offers a perfect view of the river and its surrounding nature.

            <div class="caption">4.)Panglao Island  <br>
                Panglao Island is Bohol’s very own piece of Boracay. The white sand, blue waters and the nightlife make this one of the best Bohol tourist spots. 
                Aside from the beach, the coral reefs and marine life make it a great snorkeling and diving spot as well.

                Cruising through one of the cleanest rivers in the Philippines while 
                chowing down on some of the best Filipino dishes is an experience you won’t forget. At Bohol, you can have your cake and eat it too, as they say.
