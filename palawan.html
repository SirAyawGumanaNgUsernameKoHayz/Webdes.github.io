                One simply cannot go to Puerto Princesa without having going on a tour of the Underground River.
                 A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature, it's one of the world's longest underground rivers.

            <div class="caption">2.)Sabang Beach  <br>
                While Sabang Beach serves as the port for boats that can take you to the Underground River entrance, 
                it's also a beach that is worth visiting.
                Featuring a long shoreline that is dotted with restaurants and resorts, 
                it's also a nice place to get your dose of sun, sand, and sea.

            <div class="caption">3.)Entalula Island  <br>
        
The soft white sand that lines the shore of this island make it one of the usual lunch stops during tours. Aside from enjoying a picnic on the sand,
 tourists also highly recommend going on a swim in its turquoise waters and snorkeling to see the island's magnificent corals and fishes.

            <div class="caption">4.) Immaculate Conception Cathedral  <br>
                The Immaculate Conception Cathedral is a beautiful Gothic-inspired church built in 1961. 
                However, its foundation dates back to the late 1800s when it was just a small chapel during the Spanish colonial era.

                The Big and Small Lagoons are staples in El Nido's Tour A itinerary. Surrounded by limestone cliffs, 
                both lagoons feature crystal clear waters which make them perfect for swimming and snorkeling. 
                You can also rent kayaks and paddle along the surface.
